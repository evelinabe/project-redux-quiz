# Redux quiz group project

This week’s project was made as a team-project during two collaboration days.
Team-members were Agnes Harrysson Hansson, Emma Urman, Evelina Berg, Gabriella Bolin and Petra Almgren
Our task was to build a quiz game using Redux. We chose to do a multiple choice Christmas themed quiz with seven pre-defined questions and three possible answers which is presented to the user. We used radio buttons for the options.

## The project
We started out with planning and sketching in Jamboard to decide what type of quiz and questions to use and what components to build. After that we talked about how to plan our work. We started out with mob programming to learn more about redux together and then proceeded to divide into smaller groups for styling, submitting answers in current question component and the summary component.

We used ‘useDispatch’ and ‘useSelector’ for using data from the store. It got a bit tricky for us that we chose to have radio buttons since we needed to push the chosen option into a submit button and to make it possible only choosing one.

To add some extra learning to the projects we chose to use Styled components instead of CSS for the styling of the site. Since this is very new to us that took some extra time to make it work correctly. We learnt a lot by using new methods and by merging it all together continuously.

If we had more time we would add progress bar that fills up, more styling and maybe some funny images and gifs.
